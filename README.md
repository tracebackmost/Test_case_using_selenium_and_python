# Test_case_using_selenium_and_python

Test case using Selenium + Python + PyTest + Page Object

1) Autotests are implemented in Python 3 and Selenium Webdriver;
2) The test framework PyTest is used in autotests;
3) The PageObject pattern is implemented in autotests;
4) When tests fail, reports are generated;
5) You must first install the driver for your browser. In this project, I used the Google Chrome browser.

To install, open the site https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ 
and download that version of ChromeDriver, which matches the version of your. 
To find out the Google version, open a new window in Chrome, type: chrome://version/ in the search bar 
and press Enter. In the top line, you will see information. 
Unzip the downloaded file and put it in the project folder.
